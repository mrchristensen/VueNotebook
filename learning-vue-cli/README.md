# Learning the Vue CLI

In this set of lessons, you will learn about the [Vue
CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/) tool. This tool helps you to scaffold and prototype
new projects in Vue. In particular, the tool makes it easier to use:

- [Vue Single File Components](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/single-file-components.html),
  which let you put all your code -- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript -- for a single
  component of your application into one file. This makes it easier to organize your application into modular pieces.

- [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/), which provides a way to
link between different web pages in your application. This makes it easier
to organize your application into multiple pages.

- [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), which will compile
your code for you. This provides a wide range of features that
are helpful. It will (a) compile single file components into their separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, (b) combine your JavaScript files into a single file and compress them so your web pages load faster, (c) ensure your code is portable (so it works with all browsers, even if they don't support the latest ES6 features), and (d) automatically reload your front end when you change it.

The Vue CLI also provides a way to configure [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/), which helps manage the data your application stores in the front end. However
we will not be covering this part.

We'll cover the Vue CLI in the following lessons:

- [Lesson 1](/tutorials/lesson1.md): Installing and using the Vue CLI

- [Lesson 2](/tutorials/lesson2.md): The Architecture of a Vue Application

- [Lesson 3](/tutorials/lesson3.md): Building an App
